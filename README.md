# Here is my assignment you sent me to develop as per the requirement i create server and Create API's to perform Crud Operation
# in this micro web app there are ther pages
# / (Register Page)
# /login (login page)
# /Users (Users page)

1. first when someone open this webapp it will show register then user have to register he/she have to fill form and succesfully posting data on the server it will automatically redirect us to login page i use (react-router-dom) and navigation hook to redirect to pages without refreshing the page

2. after user have to put the credential in login form after successfully login it will give use response with accessToken i also create jwt verification as it was bonus create all the function also test it as middlewear inside postman but didn't impelemnt on client side just to save time also i can do pagination or sorting it's not a big deal but didn't did in this project

3. after that login page will redirect us to user where we will see all the user there will be two button first delete when we click on it it will be deleted instantly and second button is update we can update username and email also we need to password for that user because it's a dummy project we can delete all the user but using jwt we can pass a condition only singin user can delete or update it's user

4. create a .env file and paste this for connection and jwt
MONGO_URL='mongodb+srv://mohddanish:Danish1998@digisidekick.rtwmhns.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
JWT_SEC="jsonToken"
