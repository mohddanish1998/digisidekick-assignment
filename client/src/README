#here is my micros full stack app as per the Assignment i developer all the thigns 

1. create two separate folder client and API
2. client save we have our front end 
3. API folder have our backend logic
4. for database use mongodb

# i follow professional standard for folder structure to implement front end and for backend too 
a. create three separate pages Register, Login, User

  a1. first when the user open our app register page will create api for authenication and for user register user can register itself 
      after succesfully register user will redirect to another page Login i did use here useNavigation hook to redirect user 
  
  a2. when the user will came to login user need to write it's credentials that he/she register just moment ago after successfully login token 
      will be generate that will store inside sessionStorage after succesful response user will again redirect to our final page where all the 
      register use will be shown in listView
  
  a3. in the User page i create UI to list all the user ther is two button one is for delete and second one is update if the user will click on 
      any user delete btn that user will be delete instantly using our API because it's a dummy project we can delete any user but for realword 
      we can only delete our own user

  a4. in the second button when the user will click on update that specific user update container form will be open and user can update it's
      username and email instantly our own API that i create user have pass password of that same user 


please create .env file inside API folder and paste this Variables 
MONGO_URL='mongodb+srv://mohddanish:Danish1998@digisidekick.rtwmhns.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
JWT_SEC="jsonToken"

Note: also create all json web token we can also use this as middlewear and i can also impelement pagination and sorting that is not a big 
deal but for now it think it's fine
